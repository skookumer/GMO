Just_xclat_and_rules.py is the central de/eclat function and the rule generator. This is the neatest code.

testbed.py contains these functions along with a lot of commented out code from different experiments as well as I/O and old versions of the function

comparison.py contains the PAMI functions and plots

Sorry if this is a mess, I just changed all the values as I went in different places. Not sure of what the expectations are for assignments like this.
